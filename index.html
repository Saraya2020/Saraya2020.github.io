Welcome to my world
My name is Saraya(suh-ray-uh) if it's hard for you to say you can just call me raya.
I had a long week well it felt like it. I'm almost ready to start my second entreeprenuer business which is making organic lip gloss and I am so excited to start this business. Because you know I really enjoy doing it like it's my passion and it's very calming to me. I also enjoyed spending time with my family like, I was riding my bike, yesterday I helped my dad clean the cars, went to the store and yea. It's fun to me because I'm like the type of person that doesn't like being in the house at all and sometimes even for a long time. I've also have been on a work-out journey and basically I've been doing thigh workouts every other day. Then I have been going walking like literally almost everyday so yea.
