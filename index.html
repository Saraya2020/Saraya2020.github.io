  <h2>About</h2>
  <br><br>
  <p>My idea was to have a hair and nail shop and a spa to have the day to themselves and feel good about themselves. Also for the single mothers it would be a day care for the kids so you know the mothers could have some time to themselves, and do their own thing and feel like they have the day to themselves for a minute. A little cafe will also be included, I know sometimes when I go get my hair done it is early in the morning and my mom doesn't have time to stop to get me breakfast so it'll just be at the shop when you get there.

      <p>It is literally how I feel early in the morning going to get my hair done and then I get hungry so it’s like I just put two and two together.</p>

      <p>Who doesn't get their hair and their nails done at the same time. So might as well just do it all at one time and then I want you to make you feel as relaxed as possible, so I added a spa.</p>

      <p>Also to benefit the lives of single mothers with children and provide the care that they need to relax and do them for a day. Well I would do it for free and to get money so it can be profitable or unprofitable. But we can do fundraisers and cookouts. You know different things.</p>
